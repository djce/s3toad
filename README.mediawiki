== s3toad ==

A quick and ugly utility for working with AWS S3.

== Build ==

 mvn clean install assembly:single

== Usage ==

 $ java -jar s3toad.jar args
run it with no args to get usage help.

If it is run on a ec2 instance then it will auto detect the roles of the instance, otherwise it can be configured via env-vars. e.g.:
 $ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="my-id-key" export AWS_SECRET_KEY="my-secret-key"

To upload:
 $ java -jar s3toad.jar push ~/media/file some-bucket --threads 5
where 5 is number of threads to use when uploading.

To upload as a new file name:
 $ java -jar s3toad.jar push ~/media/file some-bucket other_file

NOT IMPLEMENTED: To watch a drop-directory and its sub-directories and DELETE the files after successful upload:
 $ java -jar s3toad.jar watch ~/media some-bucket --threads 5
where 5 is number of threads to use when uploading.

To generate pre-auth URLs (valid for 3 hour):
 $ java -jar s3toad.jar url some-bucket /my-file.tar.gz --expiry 3
Then give the URL it returns to curl, wget, axel or some other download tool.

To get partial-upload stats:
 $ java -jar s3toad.jar status some-bucket

To clean up all incomplete multi-part uploads:
 $ java -jar s3toad.jar clean some-bucket
